# CSC 496 - Senior Seminar - Spring 2021

This is the code for my submission of the CSC 496 Module 10 project in Spring 2020 @ EKU.

The purpose of this assignment was to Create a github pages site that contains an html version of the graphs that we graphed in the GNUPlot of the benchmarks for different games that were tested at different resolutions.
